                                As the Senior Deputy Governor of Nepal Rastra Bank, a position I have held since
                                March 9, 2021, I firmly believe that honesty, perseverance, and hard work are the
                                cornerstones of shaping one's identity. In my view, moral integrity and honesty are
                                the true treasures in a person's life. During my tenure, I have played a pivotal role
                                in helping Nepal Rastra Bank achieve its objectives. My contributions have spanned
                                across various domains, including the development of a secure payment system,
                                the successful regulation and supervision of banks and financial institutions, the
                                creation and execution of monetary policy, and the management of foreign
                                exchange.

                                Recently, to enhance the formulation of monetary policy, Nepal Rastra Bank
                                established a Monetary Policy Advisory Committee, which includes participation
                                from external experts. I have had the privilege of leading this committee as its
                                coordinator. The committee provides recommendations on the stance, objectives,
                                instruments, and monetary aggregates for future monetary policies, considering
                                both domestic and global economic conditions. Under my coordinated leadership,
                                significant initiatives have been taken to improve foreign exchange management.
                                These efforts include facilitating debt and investment processes, streamlining
                                principal and interest repayments, attracting foreign investment, and encouraging
                                remittance inflows. Through efficient portfolio management of foreign exchange
                                reserves, Nepal has seen substantial benefits. Additionally, I have served as the
                                coordinator of the Microfinance Victims' Problem Resolution Committee, established
                                by the Government of Nepal to address issues related to microfinance. The
                                committee's report has paved the way for resolving these challenges

                                Jhapa, Ward No. 13. From a young age, I was a diligent student. My father was a
                                secondary school inspector, and my mother was a school teacher. In our household,
                                we managed all the domestic tasks ourselves, from caring for livestock to growing
                                vegetables and helping in the kitchen. Time management was challenging,

                                Morang Campus in Biratnagar during the 2045-2047 period. In 2050 BS, I completed

                                In Baisakh 2061 BS, I was promoted to Officer Second through an internal

                                tenure in the Internal Audit Department allowed me to closely observe the central
                                bank's internal control systems and understand the necessary governance

                                the role of department head. I led the creation of process documents, an Audit
                                Charter, Risk-Based Internal Audit protocols, and the Three Lines of Defense Model,
                                establishing a robust internal audit framework. I also facilitated foreign training
                                opportunities for staff, enhancing their understanding of internal auditing's
                                importance within the central bank. As a result, employee motivation increased, and
                                they now take pride in being transferred to the Internal Audit Department.

                                the interest rate corridor, and the practical application of monetary policy through
                                open market operations, crucial in achieving price and interest rate stability. Amidst
